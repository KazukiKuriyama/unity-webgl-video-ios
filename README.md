# unity-webgl-video-ios
WebGL's Video feature that also works on iOS
# Notes
* Currently, it is only possible to operate after building, and it cannot be operated on UnityEditor or other platforms.
* Due to browser security rules, even if you use this source code, you must tap the screen once before playing the audio. If the tap is made after the timing when the audio is originally played, the audio for that video will not be played. *Under investigation
